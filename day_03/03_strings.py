#Single quotes and double quotes can be used
print("HELLO WORLD")
print('we are learning python with Dr Aammar on Codanics')

#single quotes and double quotes can be used together if we need to give output in quotation marks
print('I am "arslan"')
print("We are 'learning' with Aammar") 

#Triple quotes use for multiple strings
print('''
      I am Aammar.
      Meri mama mjhy chnad jaisa kehti hain.
      i am still young
''') 

#when you are writing in quotation mark be careful with spaces becuse it prints in output
print("What's up?")

# spaces does not matter in operators but the value end with number 
#  yh hum nah lihka basically how logic work 
print("2+3")

#binary data operate through boolean
True
False

#what is binary data?
#binary data is a sequence of 0 and 1
# 0 is false and 1 is true
# 0 and 1 are called bits
# 0 and 1 are called binary digits
# 0 and 1 are called binary numbers

#Assignment: what is type casting and how do we use that in pyhton?
#type casting is converting one data type to another data type
#example:
#int()
#float()
#str()
#bool()
#example:
print(int(2.3))
print(int(2.9))
print(int(2.0))
print(int(2.1))
print(int(2.9))
print(int(2.99))
