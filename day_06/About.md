# In this lecture you will learn how to improt dataset in pandas and run basic commands

## Data

- Dataset is a collection of data records
- Data Frame made up of columns, rows, index, variables
- Unit --> KG , ft

## Data Science Steps

- Data Collection
    * Original --> Primary Data
    + Kisi ka data --> Secondary Data
    + Kaggle / Github
  
### Data Science

- Insight deta ha Future ke / usi ka andr trends hoty hain
- chupa huwa raz nikalna analyze kr ka
- Primary --> Cost , link , Famous , statistical , non-bias
- Secondary --> Google/Youtube
- Secondary is valuable
- Primary is valube for researcher  but not useful for busines
- Yahan sa data lo --> Kaggle, Google dataset, Github, Faostats, scrap from websites
- stats sites of every country
- DNA, NADRA, Forensics
- Bussiness --> stock exchange
- Uni Database
- **Research**

## Working

- Data in Python using pandas
- seaborn/scikit-learn --> builtin dataset
  
_Here are some of the key reasons why the Pandas library is important in Python:_

📊 **Data Manipulation:** Pandas allows you to easily manipulate large datasets using its powerful DataFrame data structure. You can select, filter, group, pivot and transform your data efficiently.

📈 **Data Analysis:** Common data analysis tasks like cleaning, wrangling, aggregating, joining and reshaping data are built into Pandas fundamentally. This accelerates your analysis workflow.

📝 **Data Visualization:** While not as fully-featured as Matplotlib/Seaborn, Pandas makes basic data visualization very easy via plotting methods on DataFrames. Great for quick exploratory plots.

🗓 **Time-Series Data:** Pandas has excellent support for loading, working with and manipulating datetime data. This makes it very suitable for analysing financial, business or any temporal data.

📦 **Data IO:** Pandas simplifies data import/export from CSV, Excel, SQL, JSON and other formats using optimized read/write methods. Great for quick ETL tasks.

📡 **APIs:** Pandas works seamlessly with popular APIs like Google Sheets, SQL, REST APIs to provide more functionality. Expand your data science beyond local datasets.

⚡ **Speed:** Optimized data structures and algorithms ensure Pandas code runs very fast even on huge datasets compared to raw Python. Ideal for big data tasks.

> In summary, Pandas empowers data scientists with an integrated toolkit for data wrangling, munging, cleaning, analysis and visualization in Python – making it an essential library for data manipulation and analysis tasks
